# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Morewood traffic light"      # Project title
  description:  "Functions as a traffic light & cross walk light signals which takes in inputs of which cars are waiting and if the pedestrian crossing button has been pressed."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "FSM-D Uses an FSM (Moore style) to control the different states for each light for each car/ped waiting. Also uses multiple counters (to count the time allotted for cars to go in each direction) and a register to hold whether the pedestrian crossing button has been pressed."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  ""      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "INPUT: 1 pedestrian waiting to cross input [ped], 3 car waiting signals for each (straight) direction [car1, car2, car3], 1 car waiting signal for the turning lane [car 4] | OUTPUT: 3 LEDS (red, yellow, green) for each direction (9 total) [red1, yellow1, green1, etc.], 1 additional LED for the turn signal (could be any color) [turn], 2 LEDS (orange and white) for whether the pedestrian should cross or not [orange, white]"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "SystemVerilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
